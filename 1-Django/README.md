# 1. Introduction to Django - Fırat Tamur - 02.12.2019

Short description of used technologies and purpose of the workshop.

This workshop provides a sample of how [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) can help you build Web applications using Python. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source. In this workshop, we will create a blog site with Django framework then deploy our site on the pythonanywhere.com website with a free account.

## What you'll build

You'll build a simple personal blog using Django Framework and publish it. You'll create and update your posts in your blog with django admin panel.
